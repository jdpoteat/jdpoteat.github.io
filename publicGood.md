> "Public Virtue cannot exist without private, and public Virtue is the only 
Foundation of Republics."

> "There must be a positive Passion for the public good, the public Interest, 
Honor, Power, and Glory, established in the Minds of the People, or there can be
no Republican Government, nor any real Liberty."
- John Adams

## Jefferson's Elementary Philosophers

### Locke & Sidney

* Limited government, majority rule, and protection of natural rights of 
individuals
* Ideals of the Enlightenment

### Aristotle & Cicero

* Importance of government in human affairs, components of good government, and 
the cruciality of concern for the public good
* "A state exists for the sake of the good life, and not for the sake of life 
only...Political society exists for the sake of noble actions, and not of mere 
companionship."



--- {background: "#FFF1E0"}
## Jefferson's Conflicting Ideas?

* Believed in both the public good and in unifying personal liberty with political
freedom 
* Wanted to combine Locke/Sidney's idea of individual rights with 
Aristotle/Cicero's ideas of the government acting to create the good life



--- {background: "#FFF1E0"}
## Federalists Papers

* Argues for why government is necessary to promote the public good
* Discussed In: 01, 12, 37, 57, 70, and 78
* Neutralize faction to uphold the permanent and aggregate interests of the 
community (No.10)
* Representatives possessing the most wisdom to discern, and the most virtue to 
pursue, the common good of the society (No.57)



--- {background: "#FFF1E0"}
## Massachusetts Constitution

* Helmed by John Adams
* "Empowerment of government lest the state sink into anarchy"
* Goal: To fulfill the common interest and to nourish the good life

3 Duties for Legislators:

1. Cherish the interests of literature and the sciences
* Support and teach the principles of humanity
* Promote sincerity, good humor, and social affections among the people

General belief that government had a broad power and responsibility to pursue 
the public good

## James Madison on R&E

### Religion
Morality is best enhanced by leaving religious worship to unestablished churches

* Example: [Virginia's Statute for Religious Freedom](http://billofrightsinstitute.org/resources/educator-resources/americapedia/americapedia-documents/va-statute-for-religious-freedom/)

### Education

A government without information or a means of acquiring it will lead to tragedy

"Knowledge will forever govern ignorance: And a people who mean to be their own 
Governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives." - Madison (50)

* Example: [Morrill Act, “grant-in-aid” programs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrill_Land-Grant_Acts)

## Constitution on R&E

Constitution takes two different approaches

### Religion
1st Amendment explicitly forbids the governmental establishment of religion

### Education
Education is left in the hands of the states and private entities

## Big Ideas of Constitution so Far

Constitution - Combination of the best of the Aristotelian and Lockean 
approaches to government

* Constitution does "limit" in the sense that it acts as a "barrier to unwise 
and illegitimate actions," (52). 
* Constitution is NOT a necessary evil; it is a tool for progress and promoting
public good

Pursuing public good is important, even when it means prohibiting certain powers
to the federal  government, or leaving them to the states

## Preamble

> We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, 
establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, 
promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves 
and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United 
States of America.

Note - The Preamble holds no legal clout, but its words serve as a foundation 
for shaping of the Constitution



--- {background: "#FFF1E0"}
## 01 - A More Perfect Union

* Deals with the structure of government and the quality of the bonds of its 
people

* A more perfect union would offer the sort of bonds of friendship and concern for
the public good vital for citizen cooperation

* Proper public education is key part of forming a more perfect union 
(qualitative improvement)



--- {background: "#FFF1E0"}
## 02 - Justice

* Constitution aspired to the idea of justice - fairness, equity, compassion, and 
"minding one's own business" diligently and responsibly

* Founding Fathers realized that in using common sense, one could discover 
universal standards of justice that help define the public good



--- {background: "#FFF1E0"}
## 03 - Domestic Tranquility

* With domestic tranquility, which is part of the pursuit of public good, a 
society would be orderly, obedient to law, safe, peaceful, and unaggressive

* A government should accentuate those qualities and diminish chaos, lawlessness,
etc.

* Justice and Tranquility balance each other out



--- {background: "#FFF1E0"}
## 04 - Provide for the Common Defense

* A government must possess the "wisdom, diplomatic skill, military effectiveness,
internal vigor, and willing support of the people necessary" to ensure national
security (55)

* Assuring national integrity is surely better than one that leaves the nation 
vulnerable to violent and predatory neighbors (Fed No.02)



--- {background: "#FFF1E0"}
## 05 - Promote the General Welfare

* Hamilton - active guidance of the federal government

Example - national bank, funding the public debt

* Jefferson - believed a simple government was best; looked at the "essential 
instrumentality of state and local government"



--- {background: "#FFF1E0"}
## 05 - Promote the General Welfare

* Corruption - Opposite of the public good; The displacement of the public good by 
private interest

> What expectation can be entertained of raising a disinterested public spirit 
among men who have no other principle than that of private interest? 
- Lord Bolingbroke 



--- {background: "#FFF1E0"}
## 05 - Promote the General Welfare

Origins of Corruption:

* The presence of self-interested motivation in rulers/citizens

* The celebration of the wide variety of special interest (faction)

Note: Faction was discussed in Fed. No.10



--- {background: "#FFF1E0"}
## 06 - Secure the Blessings of Liberty

* Clarified in the Bill of Rights

* Freedom - "Not only protection from foreign powers, but also against the private
injustice of individuals, the arbitrary and lawless power of the state, and of 
every subordinate authority" (60).

* Liberties, no matter how "unalienable" are made real only when accepted and 
given effect by the government
